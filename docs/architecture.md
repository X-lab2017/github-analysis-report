## Data service

Data service is a set of data continuous integration and query services hosted by X-lab which includes:

- Collecting GitHub logs from [GHArchive](https://www.gharchive.org/) every day and import into database for later use.
- Provide data query interface with internal query queue to ensure that the database will not be overloaded.

## Database

The database for GitHub logs is a [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.tech/) cluster hosted by X-lab. Currently, the cluster contains more than 2.5 billion records of GitHub logs from 2015.01.01 till now and supports full access to all logs and real time calculation.
