# ASF

ASF is short for `Apache Software Foundation`. ASF is one of the most active foundation in the world. This report consists of basic introduction of ASF and data analysis for projects from China.

## Introduction

The `Apache Software Foundation (ASF)` is a 501(c)3 non-profit public charity organization incorporated in the United States of America and was formed in 1999 primarily to:

- provide a foundation for open, collaborative software development projects by supplying hardware, communication, and business infrastructure

- create an independent legal entity to which companies and individuals can donate resources and be assured that those resources will be used for the public benefit

- provide a means for individual volunteers to be sheltered from legal suits directed at the Foundation's projects

- protect the 'Apache' brand, as applied to its software products, from being abused by other organizations

The mission of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is to provide software for the public good. ASF helps individuals and organizations understand how Open Source at scale works in a highly competitive market. our focus has not been on producing software, but rather mentoring communities who produce software. Through the ASF's meritocratic process known as "The Apache Way", more than 730 individual Members and 7,000 Committers successfully collaborate to develop freely available enterprise-grade software, benefiting millions of users worldwide. The Apache Way advances sustainable Open Source communities: everything we do is Open Source so all kinds of users can benefit from our experience. Apache is for everyone.

### The Apache Way

The Apache Way is a set of behaviors and practices developed at the ASF and designed to promote long-lived successful projects by focusing on stable governance and encouraging new contributors. These behaviors are required of all Apache projects.

- **Community Over Code**: the maxim "Community Over Code" is frequently reinforced throughout the Apache community, as the ASF asserts that a healthy community is a higher priority than good code. Strong communities can always rectify problems with their code, whereas an unhealthy community will likely struggle to maintain a codebase in a sustainable manner.

- **Earned Authority**: all individuals are given the opportunity to participate, but their influence is based on publicly earned merit – what they contribute to the community. Merit lies with the individual, does not expire, is not influenced by employment status or employer, and is non-transferable.

- **Community of Peers**: individuals participate at the ASF, not organizations. The ASF’s flat structure dictates that roles are equal irrespective of title, votes hold equal weight, and contributions are made on a volunteer basis (even if paid to work on Apache code).

- **Open Communications**: as a virtual organization, the ASF requires all communications related to code and decision-making to be publicly accessible to ensure asynchronous collaboration, as necessitated by a globally-distributed community.

- **Consensus Decision Making**: Apache Projects are overseen by a self-selected team of active volunteers who are contributing to their respective projects. Projects are auto-governing with a heavy slant towards driving consensus to maintain momentum and productivity. Whilst total consensus is not possible to establish at all times, holding a vote or other coordination may be required to help remove any blocks with binding decisions.
- **Responsible Oversight**: The ASF governance model is based on trust and delegated oversight. Rather than detailed rules and hierarchical structures, ASF governance is principles-based, with self-governing projects providing reports directly to the Board. Apache Committers help each other by making peer-reviewed commits, employing mandatory security measures, ensuring license compliance, and protecting the Apache brand and community at-large from abuse.

## Data analysis

We calculated the activity of all Apache repositories from China and the data is as follows.

{"err":"Cannot read property 'forEach' of null"}

We also calculate the top 20 developers data and the data is as follows.

## Working Hour Distribution

We analyze the working hour distribution for ASF during year 2020, and here are the results of our working hour distribution research for every repo.

## 简介

Apache 软件基金会（ASF）成⽴于 1999 年， 是⼀个依据 501(c）在美国成⽴的非营利性公共慈善组织。基金会致力于：

- 提供基础设施：为开源项⽬提供硬件、沟通交流以及项⽬治理等层面的基础设施；

- 提供用于捐赠的法律实体：建立一个独立的法人实体，公司和个人可以向其捐赠资源，并确保这些资源将用于公共利益；

- 提供法律保护框架：为个人志愿者提供法律保护框架，避开针对基金会项目的法律诉讼；

- 提供 Apache 商标保护： 保护应用于其软件产品的“ Apache”商标，防止被其他组织滥用。

Apache 软件基金会的使命是为公共利益而提供软件。基金会帮助独立个体和组织去理解开源是如何在一个激烈竞争的市场中发挥优势的。其重点不是生产软件，而是指导生产软件的社区。通过被称为“ Apache 之道”的精英管理流程，超过 730 个个人会员和 7,000 个提交者成功合作开发了免费的企业级软件，使全球数百万用户受益。Apache 之道对于开源社区的持久发展有着显著的优势：我们所做的一切都是开源的，所有的用户都可以从中受益。Apache 是所有人的 Apache。

### Apache 之道

Apache 之道是 ASF 制定的一套行为或者惯例，旨在通过专注于稳定的治理并鼓励新的贡献者来促进长期成功的项目。所有的 Apache 项目都必须遵循以下基本原则：

- 社区大于代码：ASF 一直坚信好的软件是由强大的社区构建出来的。一个健康、多样、包容的社区，可以促进项目不断成长，可持续发展。

- 挣得权威：人人都有机会参与, 他们的影响力是基于公开获得的功绩——即他们为社区做出的贡献。功绩属于个人、不会过期、不受就业状况或雇主的影响, 同时不可转让。

- 同侪社区: 参加 ASF 是通过个人而不是组织进行的。ASF 的扁平化结构使得在 Apache 社区里大家相互尊重, 角色平等, 每个人的投票具有同等的分量, 贡献者也是在志愿者的基础上与其他人享受一样的权利 (即使某个组织为他们在 Apache 代码上的工作提供报酬)。

- 开放沟通: 作为一个虚拟组织, ASF 要求所有通信都通过电子邮件在线进行。大多数 Apache 邮件列表都是存档的, 并且可以公开访问, 以确保异步协作, 这些是作为一个全球分布式社区所必须具备的条件。

- 共识决策：Apache 项目是自动管理的, 倾向于推动共识以保持动力和生产力。由于无法在任何时候都达成完全的共识, 此时就可能需要举行具有约束力的表决或其他协调，以帮助消除决策障碍。

- 负责任的监督: ASF 治理模式以信任和授权监督为基础, 让项目自治并直接向董事会提供报告。Apache 提交者们互相帮助：相互评审提交 、采用强制性安全措施、确保许可证合规性，以及保护 Apache 品牌和整个社区免于受到伤害。

## 数据分析

我们计算了所有来自中国的 ASF 项目仓库的活动情况，数据如下。
